#Make samples from nTuples
1. Specify samples location, name in samples-plots/python/Tools/enVars.py
2. python samples-plots/python/Tools/cutSamples.py -l LOCATIONOFOUTPUTFILE
   #to combined data, since we have A, B, C, D,
   -1 generate A, B, C, D separately in the same location (with no other sample in that directory)
   -2 specify that location in samples-plots/python/Tools/enVars.py
   -3 python samples-plots/python/Tools/cutSamples.py -a True -l LOCATIONOFOUTPUTFILE #-a tells cutSample to simply add the files with mine format
